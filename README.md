# Arjay's SQL Portfolio

### Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL queries I have created over time.

## [MDC Assignment](https://github.com/arjayjean/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/mdc_a6_assignment.sql "MDC Assignment SQL Queries")
* During my time at Miami-Dade College, I was assigned to create additional queries, along with the queries me and my classmates made in class.


## [Superhero Power Stats](https://github.com/arjayjean/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/superhero_power_stat.sql "SuperHero Power Stat SQL Queries")
* With the [ETL process](https://github.com/arjayjean/superhero_power_stat "SuperHero Power Stat ETL") I created, I was able to extract data from [Yoann Cribier's](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/ "SuperHero API") SuperHero API, tranform the data to fit MySQL's format, then load it into MySQL. I have made some queries to find data on the characters within the database.

## [Pizza Place Sales by Maven Analytics](https://github.com/arjayjean/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/pizza_place_sales.sql "Pizza Place Sales")
* With a dataset provided by [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground "Maven Analytics' Data Playground"), I quantified monthly and yearly sales and identified the total number of orders being made by the year, month, and day, along with the peak hours. The data was imported into an [AWS RDS for MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/ "RDS for MySQL").

## [SQL Murder Mystery](https://github.com/arjayjean/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/sql_murder_mystery.sql "SQL Murder Mystery")
* [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/ "SQL Murder Mystery") is a game designed for both new and experienced SQL users to solve a murder mystery using SQL concepts and commands. I have solved the mystery and looked further into why the murderer did what they did. **CASE CLOSED**!!!
