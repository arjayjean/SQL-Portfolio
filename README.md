# Arjay's SQL Portfolio

### Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL queries I have created over time.

## MDC Assignment
* During my time at Miami-Dade College, I was assigned to create additional queries, along with the queries me and my classmates made in class.


## Superhero Power Stats
* With the [ETL process](https://github.com/arjayjean/superhero_power_stat "Arjay Jean's SuperHero Power Stat ETL") I created, I was able to extract data from [Yoann Cribier's](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/ "SuperHero API") SuperHero API, tranform the data to fit MySQL's format, then load it into MySQL. I have made some queries to find data on the characters within the database.
