# Arjay's SQL Portfolio

### Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL queries I have created over time.

## [MDC Assignment](https://github.com/arjayjean/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/mdc_a6_assignment.sql "MDC Assignment SQL Queries")
* During my time at Miami-Dade College, I was assigned to create additional queries, along with the queries me and my classmates made in class.


## [Superhero Power Stats](https://github.com/arjayjean/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/superhero_power_stat.sql "SuperHero Power Stat SQL Queries")
* With the [ETL process](https://github.com/arjayjean/superhero_power_stat "SuperHero Power Stat ETL") I created, I was able to extract data from [Yoann Cribier's](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/ "SuperHero API") SuperHero API, tranform the data to fit MySQL's format, then load it into MySQL. I have made some queries to find data on the characters within the database.

## [Pizza Place Sales by Maven Analytics](https:// "Pizza Place Sales")
* In this project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. Before I began visualizing the data in Tableau, I use MySQL queries to identify what statistics are available. This data is stored in the cloud using [Amazon's RDS for MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/ "RDS for MySQL"). The data was provided by Maven Analytics in their [data playground](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground "Maven Analytics' Data Playground") where they share datasets that allows aspiring data analysts to practice with "real-world" data.
